**Cryptocurrency:  Why it’s still an alternate investment avenue and not the decentralised currency it is touted to become.**

**Abstract**

This study aims to provide statistically conclusive evidence on the reasons for volatility in the cryptocurrency market. It also aims to study the adoption figures and major use cases for the current cryptocurrencies. This data is used to study whether the price of cryptocurrencies in the current market is due to its current, potential and viable use cases or is due to speculative bubbles as a result of investments with high-return expectations. The study also outlines how the cryptocurrency market will mature and break-out from the financial market, moving ahead.  



**Literature Review**

Cryptocurrencies have recently attracted a great deal of interest from investors, central banks and governments around the world. In the absence of any form of political regulation and the market being far from 'efficient', new forms of regulation will be needed in the near future. From an econometric perspective, it has been established that the processes underlying the evolution of cryptocurrency volatility have both differences and similarities with other financial time series.[1]

The internal cryptocurrency market study results provide strong evidence supporting the progress of cryptocurrency market integration and further support the findings by earlier studies on interdependencies within the cryptocurrency market. The cross financial markets study suggests that cryptocurrency can combine some of the advantages of both stocks and bonds in the financial markets and therefore be a useful tool for portfolio management, risk analysis, and market sentiment analysis. We find that the linkages between the cryptocurrency market and other financial markets are stronger in the countries where cryptocurrencies are more accepted and used.[2]

In general, it is found that a high investor sentiment leads to an increase in the trading volume of Bitcoin and Ethereum. On the other hand, a low investor sentiment leads to a lower volatility of Bitcoin and Ethereum.[3]

Econometric results on the impact of GPR on cryptocurrencies offer many interesting insights. There is evidence that geopolitical risk is a strong predictor of returns and positive volatility for Bitcoin and other major digital currencies. Additionally, GPR has proven to be a powerful factor in determining whether Bitcoin acts as a portfolio diversifier, hedge, or safe haven for other assets. Furthermore, it shows that Bitcoin can act as a hedge against geopolitical uncertainty.[4]

Findings suggest (a) the BTC crash of 2018 could have been modelled and explained accurately using these methods; (b) forecasts of both the direction and the magnitude of BTC volatility are more precise than those of forecasted BTC returns; (c) returns of global stock markets and gold do not have a causal effect on BTC returns. However, smaller cryptocurrencies (ex: XRP) are more sensitive to gold prices and general stock market volatility, and can have a causal effect on BTC prices; (d) primary factors influencing BTC prices are some measures of fear (as proxied by GVOL and VIX), and other cryptocurrency returns (as proxied by XRP).[5]

Trading volume appears to have significant long-run impact on Bitcoin at 1% significance level and on Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero at 10% significance level, indicating a unit increase in weekly trading volume causes 0.14, 0.13, 0.06, and 0.03 raises in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero cryptocurrencies in long-run. In case of short-run dynamics, all five cryptocurrencies earn statistically significant estimates. However, these estimates seem to be lesser than their long-run magnitudes, indicating that responses of the cryptocurrencies to the fluctuations in market trading volume are higher in long-run.[6]

Likewise, volatility of the cryptocurrency market appears to be statistically significant determinant both in long- and short-runs for all cryptocurrencies. The sign of impact is negative, which indicates a unit increase in volatility of the market causes Bitcoin to drop by 0.15 units, Ethereum by 0.15 units, Dash by 0.02, Litecoin by 0.02 units, and Monero by 0.01 units in long-run. In case of short-run, these impacts seem to be several-fold, indicating that the cryptocurrencies show more severe reaction to the market's volatility in short-run.[6]

In case of control variables, SP500 index derives weak form of positive significant coefficient (10% level) in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin models. Although the logic behind these positive long-run relationships appears ambiguous, they totally disappear in short-run, while only Bitcoin model predicts a negative estimate that is statistically significant 10% significance. This confirms that one could expect a stronger USD against other fiat currencies (including cryptocurrencies) when SPP increases.[6]

NIKKEI and S&P500 are the largest recipients of stocks in the system, followed by the remaining stocks including CAC40, DAX30, FTSE, FTSEMIB and SP/TSX. They are the greatest receivers and therefore the greatest senders. This therefore confirms the contagion of the COVID-19 crisis among the G7 stock markets. In contrast, the NIKKEI and S&P500 are the worst performers. As a result, the US and Japanese stock markets are more attractive to investors as they are less exposed to other market shocks. However, we come to the conclusion that Bitcoin Gold and Litecoin are the least-received of the other cryptocurrencies and may diversify during the crisis. Ethereum and Bitcoin are the largest senders of other cryptocurrencies, confirming their importance and influence on the cryptocurrency market. Gold, on the other hand, has seen low senders and receivers and is a safe asset. Investors can therefore diversify their portfolios and reduce risk by adding Bitcoin Gold and Litecoin when investing in the gold and G7 stock markets.[7]

The cryptocurrency market is unregulated and highly speculative (Hameed and Farooq 2016). When the investor sentiment is exceptionally pessimistic or optimistic, there is a possibility of extreme movement in the prices.[8]

The above observations, references and studies have attempted to answer the reason for volatility in the cryptocurrency market and how cryptocurrency can be used as an alternate investment avenue. However, none of the studies have considered the use cases and how they are affecting the prices and volatility. 





**Need for research**

- This study aims to disprove the misunderstandings and scepticisms associated with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market statistically. 
- It also aims to bring awareness on the intended and viable use cases for cryptocurrencies moving ahead.
- The study also aims to supplement previous studies on cryptocurrencies by taking the approach of studying intended use cases and current adoption, rather than correlating the financial markets with the cryptocurrency market directly. 


**Objectives of Study**

- To examine and study the key factors that drive the process and volume of cryptocurrencies in the current market. 
- To elaborate and describe the correlation between cryptocurrency market and financial market, if any.
- To study micro-trends within the cryptocurrency market – correlation between BTC and other coins in the absence of any macro-trend. 
- To study the intended use cases of some cryptocurrencies and study the adoption of the intended use case. 
- To forecast future prices and volatility as adoption of the intended use cases increases.


**Methodology**

1. Brief about the underlying technology and the intended use cases of cryptocurrencies. 
1. Collect price and volume data of cryptocurrencies, traditional financial markets and gold and derive a correlation between the three assets. 
1. Comment on the reasons for correlation, if any.
1. Study the co-variance between the three asset classes if any and comment on reasons for the same. 
1. Study the correlation between BTC and other cryptocurrencies in the absence of any macro-trend externally. 
1. Collect holding time, adoption numbers, nature of transaction (what the transaction was made for) and flow of capital (into or out of) for cryptocurrencies. 
1. Based on the data, analyse and infer the current factors driving the prices and comment on the same. 
1. Also determine the extent of presence and effect of speculative bubbles in the cryptocurrency market, based on the price and volume fluctuations.
1. Compare the early stages of traditional financial markets and the current stage of cryptocurrencies and draw inferences on the correlation. 
1. Analyse and valuate the population of the cryptocurrency industry and arrive at a statistical inference by extrapolation of current population.

**Cryptocurrency: Brief Overview Of The Underlying Technologies And Processes**



A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that acts as a medium of exchange on a computer network independent of a central authority such as a government or bank to maintain or maintain it. It is a decentralized system for verifying that parties to a transaction have the money they claim to own, rather than traditional intermediaries such as banks when transferring funds between two entities.[9]

Records of individual coin ownership are digital, computerized databases that use strong cryptographic techniques to protect transaction records, control the creation of additional coins, and verify the transfer of coin ownership. Cryptocurrencies do not exist in physical form (such as banknotes) and are not usually issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to central bank digital currencies (CBDC).[9]


In general, a cryptocurrency is considered centralized if it is created or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency operates on a distributed ledger technology (usually a blockchain) and acts as a public database of financial transactions. Traditional asset classes and macroeconomic factors such as currencies, commodities and equities have modest exposures to cryptocurrency returns.[9]

The first decentralized cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, first released as open source software in 2009. As of March 2022, there are over 9,000 cryptocurrencies on the market and over 70 cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of over $1 billion.[9]

Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer block reward incentives to miners. Rewards paid to miners increase the supply of cryptocurrencies. Ensuring that validating transactions is a costly business helps maintain the integrity of the network as long as well-intentioned nodes control much of the computing power. Validation algorithms require a lot of computing power and power to make them costly enough to accurately validate public blockchains. [9]

Cryptocurrency transaction fees are largely dependent on the network capacity offered at the time and the demand of currency holders for faster transactions. Currency holders can choose a particular transaction fee, but network entities process transactions in order of the highest to lowest fee offered. [9]

**Cryptocurrency: Brief Overview Of The Market**

We can briefly summarize the economics of the cryptocurrency market by outlining key statistics. Coin Dance6 regularly publishes current and historical reporting statistics for the cryptocurrency market. According to the latest report, Bitcoin owns 34.4% of the total market share, while Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin account for 19.23%, 10.74% and 1.97% of the share respectively. Moreover, according to their report, 96.57% of cryptocurrency market participants are male, while only 3.43% are female. Age distribution refers to the ability of the cryptocurrency market to attract a wide range of people, from very young to very old. The report included statistics for those aged 18 and over only, with 8.36% of market participants aged 18-24 and 45.71% and 30.62% aged 25-34 and 35-44, respectively. Interestingly, the proportion of seniors (45+) is about 16%, which indicates that the cryptocurrency market is drawing financial activity from young to old. Cryptocurrency interest and affinity statistics also show that people in the cryptocurrency community are primarily engaged in financial activities and pursuing investment opportunities.
